# Project 1: Simple VR Scene

## Instructions

Fuse controls for mobile devices are enabled. When using a mobile device--especially Google Cardboard (version 1)--stare at the object of interest for about 1-2 seconds in order to "click" on it.

Click on the floating creeper coins to teleport just below them for navigation. This is especially crucial for mobile users.

Click the light switch by the fridge to toggle the lighting on that side of the room on and off.

Click on the Boombox Handle to start an audio track. The track can't be stopped at the moment, so I don't suggest turning it on until you're ready to stop the experience, in case you don't want to listen to the track the whole time.

Use the datGUIVR controls by the refrigerator to modify the X scale and X position of the refrigerator in real-time. This will ***NOT*** work for those using Google Cardboard (version 1) because there is no way to properly click on this GUI tool with this setup.

Notice the use of Normal, Diffuse, and Occlusion maps for the walls--and Displacement, for the ceiling--but I'm afraid the displacement map isn't very noticeable, in this case.

## Credits:

Some of the models did not have clear owners, so I linked to the places where I got them in the index.html file. If I made any changes, those will be documented in-context inside of the index.html file as well.

Thanks to [Assorted Letters](https://www.instagram.com/assortedletters/) for providing me with some templates to go off for the Creeper Coin and the Piano keys, as well as some tips.

Thanks to [DitzyDoodler](https://ditzydoodler.tumblr.com/) for generously offering to make some models for me, such as the tables, chairs, boombox, monitor, and bed. Additional thanks for the constant support and advice, as well as guidance when using Blender.

Partial credit to [midkay](https://twitter.com/midkay) as he is working on the audio track with me. I had to include the most stripped-down version of the track, because any other version would not load due to the large filesize.

If not specified otherwise (on here or in the index.html file), any other used assets can be considered to be my own work.

Cup of Tea: https://free3d.com/3d-model/glass-896441.html
I modified the specular values and removed the light and plane. I also changed the rendering engine due to some technical issues.

Floor: Nothing special. Just a partially reflective red flooring I made, since the desired texture would not load.
